# ML-24-25-09-Creating-Text-from-images-with-OCR-API

The goal of this project is to implement an OCR solution that leverages the Terrasect SDK. The C# application should load images from an input folder. Your task is to develop an application that preprocesses images by shifting, rotating, or applying other suitable transformations. After preprocessing, the application should extract text using the Terrasect API.
The quality of the extracted text depends on factors such as image quality, lighting conditions, the angle of the image, and potentially other variables, which should be assessed during the project.
The final solution must function as a console application that accepts various parameters. The output should be clear and include the extracted text from different preprocessed images. Additionally, the final result must provide a comparison of the extraction quality between various preprocessing approaches.
